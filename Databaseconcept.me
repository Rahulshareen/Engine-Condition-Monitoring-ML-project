How to store prediction requests and responses in a database
Answer:
1. We will maintain a table for each request and its results.
2. Insert a new row every time prediction call is made.
3. Timestamp column is set to the current time.
4. Prediction is the modelâ€™s predicted engine condition.

Technologies which we can use are:
Sqlite
PostgreSql


Sample pgSQL query:

SELECT * FROM prediction_table
WHERE prediction = 1 ## Fail prediction
  AND timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day';
