# Engine Condition Monitoring and Deployment

This project is focused on monitoring engine conditions using machine learning techniques to detect anomalies and predict failures. It is built as part of an application process for a Junior Data Scientist & Python Backend Developer role.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Analyze engine data in real-time or batch mode
- Detect potential signs of engine malfunction or degradation
- Build a machine learning model that classifies or predicts engine condition
- Deploy the solution as an API for integration with other systems

##  Key Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature engineering for sensor data
- Classification model for engine condition status
- Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Deployment-ready Flask API or FastAPI backend
- Git version-controlled repository for full reproducibility
